### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Example Project]([https://github.com/Julienvh98/Optimizing-Santander-Cycles-Pricing](https://github.com/Julienvh98/Optimizing-Santander-Cycles-Pricing/blob/main/Optimizing%20Santander%20Cycles%20Pricing%20with%20Linear%20Regression%20and%20ARIMA.ipynb)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
